# OpenScorbot
Hello all, this is my final degree project code, **Hardware and software controller redesign and replacement for the commercial robot SCORBOT ER-IX**.

I'm sorry about the leak of documentation and the poor software code quality, but this code represents a part of my remembers from college and I want to store it here and make it available for everyone.

## Requirements for HRobot
* Linux OS
* g++>=4.7
* ncurses
* i2c port

## Requirements for LRobot
* LPC1768 microcontroller
* g++>=4.7
* mbed toolchain

## Software and hardware usage example

In this example I'm using a Beaglebone for HRobot and the LPC1768 development board for LRobot. For HRobot I would recommend to use a Raspberry PI.
